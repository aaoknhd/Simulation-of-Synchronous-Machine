# Simulation-of-Synchronous-Machine
Simulation of a synchronous machine connected to a small-scale power system

# Overview
this model is used to describe the fundamental principles of SM connected to grid-side, hydraulic + excitation block were used to simulate the output of the power system with a SM connected with a total load of 300M.V.
